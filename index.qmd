## CPSC 203 overview

-   General service course for non-majors (mostly BSc, BA and BCom)
-   Often second-ever programming course
-   Started 2019W1, single section with increasing enrolment over the years, currently above 100 students

## UDL goals

Implement for 2024W2:

-   Open access **website** with course content and **subtitled** videos
-   **Scaffolding** to local development environment
-   Accessible **slides**
-   **Randomized question bank** of enabling mastery learning

::: notes
-   Course Designer, Dr. Cinda Heeren, is a strong advocate of inclusive teaching practices and established an easily expandable framework including frequent testing.
-   Minimize threats and distractions and reduce barriers to engagement by providing easily accessible compute platform.
-   Mastery-oriented feedback using an online testing platform.

# Website and subtitled videos

## {#website-and-videos .centered background-iframe="https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/cpsc203/2023_WT2/notes/week04/videos.html" background-interactive="true"}

::: notes
-   Enhance accessibility and inclusivity of videos by adding automatically generated subtitles.
Still evaluating tool for crowdsourcing ([ClassTranscribe](https://classtranscribe.illinois.edu/){target="_blank"}) subtitles.
-   Increase support for flipped classroom model by:
-   Breaking existing recorded videos into small 4--12 mins chunks along the theoretical concepts.
-   Freeing time so the class can be interactive and demo-based (experiential learning).

# Scaffolding to local development environment

## {#pl-workspace .centered background-image="images/pl-workspace.png" background-size="contain"}

::: notes
-   Setting up a working development environment on students' machines poses a significant challenge.
-   Provide a [virtual online workspace](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/6665/instructor/question/306967/preview){target="_blank"} using the online testing platform PrairieLearn.
:::

## {#vs-code-workspace .centered background-image="images/vs-code-workspace.png" background-size="contain"}

::: notes
-   Workspace includes a popular code editor, description of exercises, and all necessary files, enabling students to start coding on day one and follow along in class.
-   Creates buffer during the first 5-6 weeks of the course to set up a working installation on students' machines, lowering the barrier for novices with support from teaching staff.
:::

# Accessible slides

## Support of Python on slides and website {.scrollable}

```{pyodide-python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine wave')
plt.show()
```

::: notes
-   Use new web technologies to run code in browser.
Another avenue to increase accessibility and interactive learning from day one.
-   Also uses web technologies making the content screen reader compatible.
-   Semantic HTML focuses on the meaning of the content, increasing the meaning of the styling.
Styling can easily be changed globally for entire set of slides.

# Randomized question bank

## {#randomized-question-variant-1 .centered background-image="images/randomized-question_variant-1.png" background-size="contain"}

## {#randomized-question-variant-2 .centered background-image="images/randomized-question_variant-2.png" background-size="contain"}

::: notes
-   Randomized question bane enables practice, good question design, and mastery learning.
-   Previous CPSC 203 undergraduate teaching assistant, Minh Anh Nguyen, working on randomized questions ([Example](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/6665/instructor/question/341155/preview){target="_blank"}].
